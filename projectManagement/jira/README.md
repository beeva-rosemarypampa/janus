# JIRA

This component provides functionality for accessing the JIRA and Confluence
SOAP and REST APIs.

## System requirements
This component was tested using JIRA 5 and Confluence 4.

## Tests

In order to run the tests, a JIRA instance needs to be running locally under
port 47623. A user with credentials janustestadmin:janusRocks should be
created. Furthermore a Confluence instance need to be running locally under
port 47624. The applications should NOT share the same user/group database.
